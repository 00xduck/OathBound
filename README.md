# OathBound
### Latest Version: 0.3.3 (Alpha)
## About
**OathBound** is a singleplayer pixel-art side-scroller progression-based story game currently in development.
It is a semi open world game with intentional limitations.
## Project Status
**OathBound** is still in early development and is not yet playable as a finished product, but only as a testing version.
However, many core features are already implemented, on which I want to build upon.
Some features include:
- Crafting System
- Worlds System
- Status Effects (e.g. strength, regeneration or burning)
- Gathering of raw materials
- Quest system
- Enemies
## Gameplay
**OathBound's** gameplay is focused on learning and progression through collection of
items, killing of enemies and completing quests.
The story is also a core part of the game, but its development is very early and I am open for suggestions!
